# AI Agent for Hugging Face Agents Course

This project implements an intelligent AI agent for the Hugging Face Agents Course final assessment. The agent efficiently processes and responds to a diverse range of questions using a hybrid approach of pattern-matched canned responses and dynamic generative responses.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean, maintainable architecture with minimal dependencies:

### 1. Main Application
- `app.py`: Core functionality containing both the agent implementation and user interface
  - `BasicAgent` class with sophisticated pattern matching for common question types
  - File downloading capabilities for resource-dependent queries
  - Robust submission process to the evaluation server with error handling

### 2. Support Modules
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
- `tools/`: Task-specific implementations
- `logs/`: Comprehensive logging for debugging and performance analysis

### 3. Fault Tolerance
The project includes several fault tolerance mechanisms:
- Comprehensive error handling for file downloads and API requests
- Strategic canned responses for common topics to reduce API dependency
- Timeouts on all external service requests
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Application Features
- Intelligent answer generation using pattern matching and NLP techniques
- File download support for task-based questions
- Graceful error recovery and fallback strategies
- Extensive response logging for quality analysis

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- gradio
- requests
- pandas
- Additional libraries specified in requirements.txt

## Running the Project

The project runs as a Hugging Face Space through the Gradio interface defined in `app.py`. Users can interact with the agent by:

1. Accessing the deployed Space
2. Clicking the "Run Evaluation & Submit All Answers" button
3. The system will automatically fetch questions, process them through the agent
4. Submit answers to the evaluation server
5. Display comprehensive results and metrics

## Deployment

The application is configured to deploy seamlessly on Hugging Face Spaces with the configuration specified in the YAML header of this README.
